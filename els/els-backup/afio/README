AFIO
====

Afio is a backup tool similar to <B>tar</B> and <B>cpio</B>.

It is not included with Red Hat 7.2, so the the directory
<B>els-backup/afio</B> contains a Makefile that will automatically download
the source code and create a binary RPM.


Why?
----

Afio has the added benefit of being able to compress files on the fly. It does
this on a per-file basis.

Tar can compress, too. But tar compresses the whole data stream. If there is
any problem in the middle, then not only this file but all other files
behind it would be unreadable.
