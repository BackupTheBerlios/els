Install from the command line
=============================

Download (see http://developer.berlios.de/project/filelist.php?group_id=204)
the module <B>els-backup-*.rpm</B> and <B>afio-*.rpm</B> and copy it onto a
floppy disc.

Log in as root and go into a temporary directory. Then install the RPM:

   server:~# cd /var/tmp
   server:/var/tmp# mcopy a:els-backup*.rpm a:afio*.rpm .
   server:/var/tmp# rpm -Uv afio*.rpm els-base*.rpm

Now enter "sysadm -> Backup -> Automatic" (see website/sysadm/backup.html#automatic)
and decide at which time in the the night the backup should happen.

You might also want to define your
"backup sets" (see website/sysadm/sets.html) to exclude or include specific
areas of your hard disk.
