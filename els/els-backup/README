Purpose
=======

This module helps you to automatically back up your whole server in the
night. You will get an e-mail with a backup report and after the backup
the tape will automatically ejected. So you basically only have to feed
a new tape each morning into your server.

Requirements
------------
els-backup needs a SCSI tape, e.g. a DDS-3 tape.

els-backup currently needs <B>afio</B> for the actual backup. Afio can
compress individual files before writing it to the tape, this is an advantage
over compressing the whole data stream, e.g. when a backup tape has an
unreadable spot.
