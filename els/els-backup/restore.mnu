Hints for the Restore Procedure

You are now presented with a list of all the files in the
backup. You should delete all the files that are *NOT* to
be restored. You can delete the following way:

CTRL-Z    delete current line
CTRL-KB   mark begin of a block
CTRL-KK   mark end of a block
CTRL-KY   delete complete block

Please be careful what you are restoring. If you restore
files in use, you could damage your system!" 17 65

	#Desc
	# Allows you to restore individual files.
	#
	#Item Usage
	# Before something starts, you will be asked a question like this:
	#
	#Question
	# Do you really want to restore 21 files?
	#QuestionEnd
	#Macro Question
	#
	# Only if you select "yes" does the restore proceed by asking you the
	# next question:
	#
	#CheckList Select restore options
	# [ ] Temp       Restore to /var/tmp
	# [ ] Overwrite  Overwrite existing files
	#CheckListEnd
	#Macro CheckList
	#
	# <B>Temp</B>: all restored file will end up in /var/tmp. For example, the
	# file usr/samba/dat/transfer/Letter.doc would end up as
	# /var/tmp/usr/samba/dat/transfer/Letter.doc. Use this option if you want manually
	# look into files or have very tight control of what file to copy back to the
	# user or not.
	# Please be sure that your /var/tmp file system does not overflow (you
	# can use <A HREF="hardware.htm#space">sysadm -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Space</A>
	# to get an overview of used and free hard disk space.
	#
	# <B>Overwrite</B>: normally an existing file is not overwritten during the
	# restore. So any existing file won't be accidentally overwritten by an older
	# file from the backup.
	# But if you know what you're doing, no one is hindering you from selecting
	# this option and overwriting even existing files.
	#
	#Item Visibility
	# This option is only visible if a file list has been imported.
