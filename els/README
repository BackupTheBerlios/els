ELS a.k.a. Easy Linux Server
============================

Departmental server
-------------------
Linux is often cited as a server. Now think --- what jobs would a normal
departmental file server have to fulfill?  For me the following comes
to mind:

- file server (for windows workstations)
- e-mail server
- caching DNS name server
- backup subsystem

However, most Linux distributions are meant to be general. To use one
distribution and set up a file server needs considerable time and skill.


Integration
-----------

Now suppose you have your file server. You add a user to Samba, so
that the user can connect to it. And now you have to add the user
a second time to another subsystem so that the user has a POP3 mailbox.
And yet another entry if you want the user reachable not just by
peter@somewhere but by peter.schneider@somewhere too.


Simplicity
----------

OK, you are keen to do all of the steps above. But when you use
a tool like 'linuxconf' or 'useradd' to add a user, you suddenly have
to know about things like user id, group id, home directory and shell.
You simply don't care about technical details, the system has to work.

Speed
-----

Install els-base and els-samba on an already running Red Hat 7.2 system
and you have a file server within 5 minutes !


Solution
--------

The solution to have a working, integrated and yet easy departmental
server is the Easy Linux Server (a.k.a. ELS) framework.
