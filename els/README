ELS a.k.a. Easy Linux Server
============================

Departmental server
-------------------
Linux is often cited as a server. Now think --- what jobs would a normal
departmental file server have to fulfill?  For me the following comes
to mind:

- file server (for windows workstations)
- e-mail server
- backup subsystem

I don't know any Linux distribution where you can have this very easily.
With every distribution you have to to have a considerable amount of
knowledge before you can enjoy the services above.

Solution
--------

But not so when you install (see website/installation.html) the Easy Linux
Server modules on top of Red Hat 7.2. Then you can, <B>within 5-15 Minutes</B>,
all of the above working.

This works because we define a rather strict environment. If the files for
the file server part are only stored at one specific place in the file
system, then we can configure Samba automatically. No need to hassle with
those issues manually.

A word of caution ...
---------------------

The Easy Linux modules have recently been ported to Red Hat 7.2. Because of
this, we are not yet that bullet-proof as the older ones for Red Hat 6.2.

Currently we are in Beta-Stage (see website/stages.shtml#b). Things work
pretty well, especially if you make your own RPMs from CVS. But don't expect
that every bug has been nailed down already.
