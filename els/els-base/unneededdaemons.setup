#Title stop unneeded daemons
#Author Holger Schurig
#Group els-base

#Desc
# This setup script disables several daemons (background processes)
# that are not really needed for a file server. The processes are not
# deleted from the system, just disabled. Use 'ntsysv' to re-enable them
# if they are really needed.
#
# Otherwise this script saves memory, keeps the number of services
# low (less services = less things that can break) and makes sure that
# nothing can suddenly change the setup.
