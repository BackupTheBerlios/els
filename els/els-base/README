Purpose
=======

This is the basic module that all others depend on. <B>els-base</B> provides:

Sysadm
------

The sysadm (see website/sysadm/index.shtml) menu basically consists of shell
scripts stored in <TT>/usr/lib/els/*.mnu</TT> and are rather simple to
create. All menu files together define the available options in the sysadm
menu.


Standard environment
--------------------

By way of setup scripts we change (or can change) various configuration
files of Red Hat. This creates a common environment.


Misc programs
-------------

With <B>els-base</B> you also get various little programs, e.g. an
easier to use editor as <B>vi</B>.
