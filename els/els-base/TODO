  write menu for sysadm-setup.pl
  check URL paths in help texts

Setup:
  check description texts
  generate documentation for the setup scripts
  generate sysadm menu around sysadm-setup.pl
  decide on mandatory scripts

Editor:
  is there a better editor as the joe-based q?
  fix the help texts in 'qrc'
  Consider e3 as an editor instead of q (can it handle large files?)
