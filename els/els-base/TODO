Sysadm:
  check all *.mnu files
  why does install.mnu suddenly not work (bash2 incompatibility?)

Setup:
  check description texts
  generate tool for auto-documentation for the setup scripts
  generate sysadm menu
  decide on mandatory scripts

General:
  is there a better editor as the joe-based q?
