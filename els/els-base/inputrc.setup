#Title Patch /etc/inputrc
#Author Holger Schurig
#MinRedHat 7.2
#Desc
# This stops the annoying command-line-completion bells in the shell
# (and other programs that use the readline library).
#
# We also define PgUp/PgDn so that they walk you through the
# command line history. Try to type some text and the the PgUp
# key ...
