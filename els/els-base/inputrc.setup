#Title no bell and history search in bash

#Desc
# Some programs, mostly the bash shell, use the readline library which
# handles line editing and command completion.
#
# The default setup of Red Hat makes the shell beep all the time, e.g.
# when you press Backspace at the left end of the line or
# when you use [Tag] for command line completions. This setup script
# disables the annoying bell.
#
# We also define PgUp/PgDn so that they walk you through the command
# line history. This way you can much quicker recall older commands.
