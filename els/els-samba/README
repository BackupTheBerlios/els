Purpose
=======

This module turns your Linux server into a windows file server.

From the windows view
---------------------

With the default configuration, your windows users will see three
drive letters:

   F:  a place for applications, normal users usually can't write here
   G:  a place for data with departmental directories
   H:  the user's home directory: each user has his own data in his H:


More on G:
----------
In G: you initially have two directories:

  G:\GENERAL     for general info, like the in-house phone list
  G:\TRANSFER    a place where people can exchange data together

Note that G:\TRANSFER has no restrictions. Anyone can create files,
anyone can delete them. The directory is not meant for long-term storage
and data safety, but as quick way to move data from one user to another one.

If you need places for long-term storage, you should do this with ...


Departmental directories
------------------------

Whenever you use "sysadm -> Users -> Groups -> Add" (see website/sysadm/groups.html#add)
to add a group, you will be asked if the system should create a department directory
for you. If you say yes, then a directory in G:\ with the same name of the group
will be created. Only members of the this group can access the files in this directory,
no other users.
