STRUCTURE
---------
I write the web site manually, by hand. I only use the *.inc and *.shtml files
for contents. A local running Apache handles the server-site-include scripts,
so I can directly view the files from the browser.

However, most web-servers don't have server-site include scripts enabled. So
a little tool 'makehtml.pl' takes the *.shtml files, executes a limited set
of SSI commands (#include, #set and #echo) and omits the result. These *.html
files are then sent to the webserver.

All of this is handled by the 'Makefile'


HTML 4.01 checks
----------------
I believe in syntactically correct HTML files. The fact that browsers
accept all kind of sluggish code is what makes browser development hard
and clumsy and the resulting browser slow and memory-intensive.

End of sermon :-)

If you want to check for HTML validity then you need first the strict
SGML checker 'nsgmls'. On Red Hat 7.2 that's part of the openjade RPM.
You also need the HTML 4.01 document type definitions from www.w3c.org.
I use these files:

/usr/lib/sgml/html401/
/usr/lib/sgml/html401/HTML4.cat
/usr/lib/sgml/html401/HTML4.decl
/usr/lib/sgml/html401/HTMLlat1.ent
/usr/lib/sgml/html401/HTMLspecial.ent
/usr/lib/sgml/html401/HTMLsymbol.ent
/usr/lib/sgml/html401/loose.dtd
/usr/lib/sgml/html401/strict.dtd
/usr/lib/sgml/html401/frameset.dtd

Now you can do a a 'make check' and validate your HTML code.
