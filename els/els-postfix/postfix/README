Postfix
=======

Postfix is an SMTP mailer similar to <B>sendmail</B>.

It is not included with Red Hat 7.2, so the the directory
<B>els-postfix/postfix</B> contains a Makefile that will automatically download
the the binary RPM, ready for installation.


Why?
----

Postfix was designed to be secure and fast, two areas where <B>sendmail</B>
does not excel. What is best: it is way easier to configure than sendmail. Even the 
documentation is quite nice (see http://www.postfix.org).
