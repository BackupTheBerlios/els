#
# SMTP RELAY
# ----------
# Postfix normally assumes that you have a dedicated (or dial-on-demand)
# line to the internet. If you only go online from time to time, then
# you need to change and uncomment the following two lines:
#

#defer_transports = smtp
#relayhost = your.provider.goes.here
# Or do it this if you won't do DNS lookups:
#relayhost = [213.165.64.20]
#disable_dns_lookups = yes



#
# YOUR E-MAIL DOMAIN NAME
# ----------------------
# Is your server named mycompany.de?  Then uncomment. Is your server named
# <whatever>.mycompany.de ?  Then leave the next line commented out.
#
#myorigin =      $myhostname


#
# VALID RECEIVING DOMAIN NAMES
# ----------------------------
# Accept mail for this domain names:
#
mydestination =  $myhostname,
                 $mydomain,
                 localhost.$mydomain,
                 mail.$mydomain,
                 www.$mydomain,
                 ftp.$mydomain
