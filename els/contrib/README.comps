comps
=====

Red Hat stores the set of packages that get installed in a text file.
This text file is stored on the Red Hat 7.2 installation CD number 1,
at /RedHat/base/comps.

The file in this directory is very similar to the module list described
in the "Select Individual Packages" (see website/rh72packages.shtml)
document. You just don't too select and delect so much when you create
your own installation CD with this file.
