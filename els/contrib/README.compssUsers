compssUsers
===========

The compssUsers file is normally stored on the first installation CD
of Mandrake in the directory /Mandrake/base. It contains the choices that
the User sees in the graphical installer.

The compssUsers file in this directory is a replacement that I'm using
at work. It shows you how you can create your own user choice.
