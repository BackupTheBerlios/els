Installation
============

When you read this file you seem already have been able to get the
CVS. Fine.


Quickstart
----------
Try

   make rpms

At least on Red Hat 7.2 you don't need to be root for this. By the way:
you should be online while doing this. That's because we have ...


Dependencies
------------
Some Easy Linux Server modules depend on software that does not come
with Red Hat 7.2:

* els-backup depends on afio
* els-postfix depends on postfix

When you enter 'make rpms' the Makefile system will find out if you
already got this additional software and downloads them automatically.



Installation of the modules
---------------------------
After you've run 'make rpms' all RPMs are found in the following
two directories:

   /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386
   /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch

If everything goes well, you should have all ELS rpms (as well as
some auxiliary rpms) in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386. Install the modules
you like by doing something like

   $ cd /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch
   $ rpm -Uhv els-base*.rpm
   $ rpm -Uhv els-samba*.rpm


Get runnung
-----------
Now you should start the sysadm menu and get used to it:

   $ sysadm

I will really soon (tm) have pages up that describe the configuration
in more detail. For now, go into the "Users" menu, select "Add" and
create a new user. Assign the user a password.

Now go to your windows workstation and logon to your newly create
Linux server by using the just created user, password and "ELS" as
workgroup.
