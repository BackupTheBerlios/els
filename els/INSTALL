Installation
============

When you read this file you seem already have been able to get the CVS.
Fine.

Getting additional modules
--------------------------
ELS depends on some RPM's that are not part of Red Hat 7.2, e.g. on
postfix. When you do a "make all" or "make rpms" the system will try
to automatically download this modules.

Installation of the modules
---------------------------
If everything goes well, you should have all ELS rpm's (as well as
/some axiliary rpm's) in usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386. Install the modules
/that you like by doing something like

   $ cd /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386
   $ rpm -Uhv els-base*.rpm
   $ rpm -Uhv els-samba*.rpm

Now you should start the sysadm menu and get used to it:

   $ sysadm
